opening-text: CHEO researchers have made important discoveries to children’s health in the past year. The annual report is both infomative and inspires people to donate to the CHEO Research Institution.

process: The CHEO annual report design combines youthful graphics with serious photography to remain lighthearted. A molecule pattern is used to reflect the medical research. The photos contain medical researchers and children patients to create empathy. Both of the languages used in the report (French and English) have been designed with equal importance.
