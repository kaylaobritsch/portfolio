opening-text: Since opening their doors in 1986 Future Skin has been providing the Ottawa area with body modifications—including tattoos, piercings and laser removal.

process: The goal of this project was to redesign a logo for a local small business. The final logo was used to create a stationery package that included a business card, letterhead and envelope design. A branding standards guide was created to keep the brand from being diluted.

type-design: <i>Bariol Bold</i> is the logo type used in the Future Skin logo. The rounded edges invite customers to trust the body modification artists at Future Skin.
type-font: Bariol Bold

colour-design: Purple has calming effects over the mind and the nerves—effectively relaxing the customers at Future Skin as they receive body modifications. The orange reflects the tattoo artist's creativity.
